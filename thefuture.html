    	<h1>The Future</h1>

        To be honest, I have no idea what the future has in store for me. But I find myself thinking about it a lot.

        <p> I'm still young and there's still so much I could too, but the options feel overwhelming sometimes. I feel like I should have some idea of what I want to do in the future, but I just don't. My future job and who I want to be is just a big question mark.

        <p> I know one day I will have to make major decisions on what I am to do, but right now I prefer thinking in the short-term for the future.

        <p> Like right now I want to graduate from UMaine in 4 years. That is the only certainty in my future right now.

        <p> Another thing I want to do in my short-term future is I want to study abroad. I think it will be an amazing experience for me. I'll experience new things and I'll be able to see more of the world. Right now, I plan on doing that the summer before my third year at UMaine.

        <p> Overall, I don't really know what the future has in store for me (which is both scary and exciting). But I'm going to try and be ready for whatever lies ahead.
