    	<h1>Why I Chose UMaine</h1>

        When it came to deciding where I wanted to go after high school, all the choices stressed me out at first. I felt as though there were a thousand college recruitment letters and emails coming my way. It's funny looking back on it because I was so excited getting my first college letter, I felt like such an adult. But then it later shifted from "yay a letter!" to "okay I'll add it to the pile..."

        <p> When I had to actually start deciding I knew two things for sure: I wanted to stay in New 
        England and I needed to go to a university that offered me a scholarship. I did want to go somewhere out of state just to get a new experiance, but I did not want to be too far away from home.

        <p> I began looking into the University of Maine because I heard about the flagship match program. That was definitely important to me. And then I started to look into the school more and I loved the campus. It looked so pretty in all the pictures, and when I went to tour the school in the winter of 2018 the snow made everything look beautiful. It was cold, but I'm pretty used to cold weather so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.

        <p> I applied early in my senior year of high school along with four other schools. As soon as I heard back from UMaine that I was accepted and qualified for the flagship program, I was so happy and I knew immediately that it was the school I was going to go to. It just felt like the place for me.
