    	<h1>About Me</h1>

        I'm from New Fairfield, Connecticut. I grew up there my entire life and coming to Maine for college is the first time I've ever lived outside my hometown. Admittedly it was kind of scary to leave my family and home behind, but so far I'm enjoying my time at UMaine.

        <p> I am the youngest of three. My brother, David, is five years older and my sister, Cara, is 7 years older. It was nice being able to get college advice from both of them. I'm close with both of my siblings. Family is a really important part of my life. </p>
