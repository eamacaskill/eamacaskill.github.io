    	<h1>What I Like to do</h1>

    	As mentioned on my 'About Me' page, I love to bake and write.

        <p> My mom and I had a sort-of tradition where we make chocolate chip pancakes every Sunday. I would always make the batter and she would actually cook them. I really enjoyed doing that so I thought to myself "hey what if I did this with desserts?" and that's what I ended up doing.

        <p> My favorite thing to bake are cupcakes, especially chocolate cupcakes. I love being able to decorate the tops, icing them and adding decorations. Plus if I mess up on one cupcake, there are several others I can get right.

        <p> Additionally I love to write. I've been writing since early in middle school. And although many of the early things I wrote are... well not good, I like to believe I've improved in my writing over the years. I tend to write chapter books, as opposed to poetry, and they're usually in the fantasy genre.

        <p> Finally, I love playing video games. My brother and I would always play together and that's how I mostly became interested in other games. I mostly play games that fall into the fantasy category. Personally, I believe video games are the best method of storytelling. What I mean is that many movies are constrained by a time-frame so viewers don't lose interest. That can negatively impact the story. Television shows can also fall under the same issue. But games can, ideally, be as long as the developers see fit. The story can have a longer time to play out and, I believe, that makes it more enjoyable. Plus, you get to interact with the story in video games which gives it more significance.

        <p> Plus video games are just fun overall.
